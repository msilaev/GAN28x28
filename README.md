Deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN)
============================================

This repository contains modification of the PyTorch DCGAN tutorial implementation:
```
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html
```
which is based on the paper

```
Radford, Alec, Luke Metz, and Soumith Chintala. "Unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional 
generative adversarial networks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06434 (2015)
```

Besides that it realizes also conditoinal GAN which  generates images satisfying the 
required condition. In the present case condition is a number 0-9. 

Instead of the 64x64 RGB images of face data set as in the original tutorial here the 
28x28 grayscale images from MNIST dataset are used 
for training. The data set is downloaded from Kaggle MNIST dataset

### Requirements

The model is implemented in Python 3.11.0 and uses several additional libraries which can be found in
`environments.yaml`.

### Setup

To install this package, simply clone the git repo:

```
git clone ...
cd ...
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate gan-tutorial
```

### Contents

The repository is structured as follows.

* `./results_gan`: resulting images generated by usual GAN
* `./results_conditional_gan`: resulting images generated by conditional GAN
* `./data`: data

### Dataset

The `./data` subfolder contains csv files with pixel intensity values for about 42000 grayscale 28x28 images. 

### Usage

To train the usual and conditional GAN launch the corresponding commands

```
python train_gan.py
python train_conditional_gan.py
```

In case of the conditional GAN the KNN classifier is trained on the generated fake dataset and 
then accuracy is calculated on the real dataset.
